Boiling the chicken in broth, however, will give it significantly more flavor. Bring the chicken broth/stock to a boil and put in whole chicken breasts. Cook until no pink remains. Depending on the size of the chicken breasts, this could take anywhere from 15 - 20 minutes.</li><li>While the chicken is boiling, put together your sauce. Whisk together greek yogurt, dijon mustard, and garlic powder together until well mixed. Add in salt and pepper, to taste.</li><li>Next, stir in dried cranberries or raisins and cashews. If you're worried about the cashews getting too soft, you could add them right before serving!</li><li>After the chicken is done boiling, I like to let it rest for about 5 minutes. This ensures that the juice stays in the chicken instead of spilling out when you cut it!</li><li>Dice up the chicken and mix it into the sauce. Serve.</li></ol>",
